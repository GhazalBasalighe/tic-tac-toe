# React + Vite + Tailwind CSS

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Features

- **Turn Indicator**: Easily identify whose turn it is - "Tick" or "Cross".
- **Win Detection**: The game detects a winner or a draw and displays the appropriate message.
- **Reset Option**: Restart the game at any point with a simple reset button.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
